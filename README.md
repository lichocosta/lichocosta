## I'm Lisandro!


### About me
I'm a self-taught web developer from Argentina, currently working at Rebrit SRL as a Frontend Developer using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. I like to learn by doing. I enjoy solving problems with web applications. I'm currently focusing on JavaScript. My main goal is to become a full-stack developer.
